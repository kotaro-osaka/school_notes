# Metaverse

Dear John,

In the following e-mail, I will give you a short summarization of the German article “Arbeiten im Metaverse: Für Gesundheit und Produktivität ein Desaster”.

The topic of the metaverse is currently discussed very intensely in the gaming sector and at work.
VR headsets are the main and most important tool for utilizing the metaverse, but this isn’t necessarily positive, as proven by new studies.
The metaverse was created by the social media company “Meta” and is believed to be the future of the company and even humanity.
However a study from the University Coburg proves that VR/XR/AR isn’t the future of the work life. This non-peer-reviewed investigation compared the results of the effect taken on 16 people after having worked in a conventional office and a virtual reality office for the same period.
The results significantly spoke in favor of the conventional office life in almost all categories and especially in relation to productivity and health. 19 percent of participants perceived working to be more stressful, 35 percent claimed the workload to be greater, 42 percent were frustrated that they couldn’t work efficiently enough and 16 percent were of the opinion that their productivity plummeted in the VR environment.
Overexertion, tired eyes, headaches and nausea were reasons of complaints and bad headset ergonomics lead to two participants leaving the experiment after one day.

Overall not much can be positively said about the metaverse and the VR headsets, but some problems like headset ergonomics and unfamiliarity with the systems are possible areas of improvement.

I hope that this summarization gave enough insight to answer all your questions.

Yours Kotaro
