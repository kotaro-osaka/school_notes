- NAT (Network Address Translation)
	- IPV4 (Protokoll)
	- Gateway, Proxy Server

- IPV6 (Protokoll)
> v4 und v6 mÃ¼ssen gleichzeitig resident laufen und kosten Leistung (CPU, RAM)
>> Dual Stack

> RAM is volatile memory used for temporary data storage, while cache is a smaller, faster type of memory that stores frequently accessed data for quicker retrieval by the CPU.
>> ram: L1, L2, L3 prioritization

**Subnetting**
- Every subnet gets its own broadcast domain
> Traffic can therefore be directed more efficiently instead of traveling through more networks
- Subnet mask defines subnet boundaries
> Limits unnecessary broadcast traffic & Network congestion
- Routers isolate broadcast domains
> Broadcast packets are contained within respective subnets

Supernet/Overarching network > Subnets
