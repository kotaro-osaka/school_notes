## Possible talking points
1. Introduce your company
	- BlueSens gas sensor GmbH
	- Specializes in manufacturing gas sensors for off-gas analysis (technique to monitor gas composition from industrial processes like fermentation - yeast to optimize yields and detects changes)
2. Outline your duties
	- Clocking in and out at start/end of day and for lunch break
	- Keep superior updated on progress
3. Give short rundown of an average day
	- Clock in between 8-9am
	- Work on unfinished tasks or inquire about next task
	- Lunch break (clock out)
	- Work until around 4pm
4. What did you learn during your internship?
	- New programming langs: C# (windows desktop app dev), Swift (apple ecosystem app dev)
	- *Know your worth* - much was asked of me, I delivered and developed multiple tools, but I was barely shown any sort of appreciation and certainly no compensation => If it was a company I’d consider working at, I’d work hard, but otherwise, if I have nothing further to gain, I wouldn’t put in so much effort again  
5. Are internships really useful?
	- Always useful for getting to know the industry and the types of people who work in it
	- Less useful when they turn out to not be prepared or experienced in dealing with interns, because you’d be doing nothing for most of the time
6. If you could change anything, what would it be?
	- I wouldn’t have such high hopes to lessen the letdown
	- 
7. Should internships be paid?
	- Wage should be based on time spent at the company and most importantly whether you helped develop something for the company, which would have usually costed them money
		=> My case: I created multiple tools they asked me to develop for company-internal purposes like better data overview
8. What do you like/dislike about your partner’s internship?
9. Imagine your partner is your boss. Ask him for a certificate of your internship.
10. What would be your ideal internship? You can be creative.
