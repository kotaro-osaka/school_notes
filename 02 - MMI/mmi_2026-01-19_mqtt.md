> Message Queuing Telemetry Transport

- IOT standard messaging protocol
- Lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport
- Minimal network bandwidth

- 3 defined **quality of service** levels (how reliable messages are delivered between publisher & subscriber)
	- 0: at most once (fire and forget)
	- 1: at least once (requires acknowledgement - PUBACK)
	- 2: exactly once (two-phase handshake - PUBREC → PUBREL → PUBCOMP)

| QoS Level | Guarantee     | Duplicates | Overhead |
| --------- | ------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| QoS 0     | At most once  | Possible   | Low      |
| QoS 1     | At least once | Possible   | Medium   |
| QoS 2     | Exactly once  | No         | High     |
